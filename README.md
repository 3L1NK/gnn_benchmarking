# ðŸ§  GNN + XGBoost Benchmarking for Stock Return Prediction

This repository contains the implementation and experiments for my **Masterâ€™s Thesis** on benchmarking Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and traditional ML models (e.g. XGBoost) for **stock return prediction**.  
It includes the data preprocessing, graph construction, feature embedding (Node2Vec), model training, and evaluation workflow.
